Epicvd downloader

It's just simple UI for youtube-dl. So you can just copy-paste links in it and download it in mp3, mp4 or webm formats.
It uses ffmpeg to change formats. By default it choose best video and audio quality itself.
Just like in original youtube-dl you can download almost anything. Videos from any king of websites. Even streams.
If it will be useful, I'll upgrade it. Maybe.

Q: How to download video stream?
A: 1. Open inspector (F12 key) on the page with video in your browser
   2. Click on "Network" tab
   3. Reload (F5 key) page and in list of "File"s find file with name ending (might be not in the end, but will be after dot)
   4. In "Initiator" column click blue (or watever) color link with right mouse button and click "Copy URL"
   5. Just paste in and download in format you want. Should work


This is a small downloader for videos and video streams.
Works on linux, windows, haven't checked iOS yet, but since it's python I believe it will work on anything. Just need some time to pack it.
